Overview

This folder contains two particle systems designed for the Cell Broadband Engine.
One uses a data parallel paradigm, the other a service model. They are designed to run on the
IBM Full System Simulator. Since the simulated environment does not include a GPU the graphics
data is sent over a virtual network to a rendering client which is in the host_gfx folder.

There are two effects: rain and explosions
